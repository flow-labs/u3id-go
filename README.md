## Developing

Do not edit the files in this repo. This repo is automatically generated as a copy of the files within the original u3id repo. If you would like to develop this module, edit the files in the original u3id repo and then run the make command to publish to this repo. This is done so that the original C code is the source of truth and there aren't two separately developed copies.
