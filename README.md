# u3id golang bindings

## Usage

Install the u3id Golang bindings with the following command:
```bash
go get github.com/flow-labs/u3idgo
```



## Developing

Do not edit the files in the github.com/flow-labs/u3idgo repo. This repo is automatically generated as a copy of the files within the original u3id repo. If you would like to develop this module, edit the files in the github.com/flow-labs/u3id-cython/u3idgo repo and then run the make command to publish to this repo. This is done so that the original C code is the source of truth and there aren't two separately developed copies.
